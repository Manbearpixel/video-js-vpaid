# OUTDATED REPO -- Please Read
============

This repository is no longer supported by myself and has been dropped. If you are looking for a working way to enable VPAID Ads within your VideoJS Player, please view my new repo: [VideoJS-VPAID Plugin](https://github.com/Manbearpixel/videojs-vpaid)

It is a very simple plugin you can use with your current VideoJS setup and isn't as complicated as this project was becoming. This project will no longer be supported by me, and I highly recommend you visit [VideoJS-VPAID Plugin](https://github.com/Manbearpixel/videojs-vpaid) instead and use that. 

Thanks for visiting, and feel free to PM me to tweet to me about any questions. [@Manbearpixel](https://twitter.com/manbearpixel)
